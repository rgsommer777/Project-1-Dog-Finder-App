# Project 1: My Dog Finder

An interactive application designed to allow users to search for adoptable dogs in their area. User enters their zip code and other selection parameters such as size, gender and age and a list of dogs is returned for browsing. When the user selects a particular dog, they are taken to a detail page with more information on that dog and presented with a map of the shelter location.
